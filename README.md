# Managed Vulkan

My own managed C++ / CLI interface for Vulkan (on my Windows machines compiled with Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition)

NOTE : most likely a leaky messy prototype

# Version 0.0.1

Two functions have been implemented (untested)
vkCreateInstance
vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties

### Todos

 - Hand code almost every struct and functions
 - Write Unit Tests
